## About
The purpose of this project is to bring to my development scenario (work and study) the practical exercises presented in the course "HTTP Networking" offered by freeCodeCamp.org together with Lane Wagner from Boot.dev.

All the practical exercises and their statements were "translated" to Python, because, as mentioned above, the intention is to bring the technologies I use closer.

The content of this repository seeks to follow the same structure as Lane Wagner's project.
